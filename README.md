# :wave: C / C ++ Project 0 Code 

Hello!

My name is Nate and this is my Project 0 Assignment, which I have attempted to do in both C and C++.

Please download either c_proj0 or cpp_proj0, cd into either folder, run the make command, and then run the hello_world file in linux terminal. They text outputs should be the same for both files.

Note: I also included the initial hello.c and hello.cpp files for extra documentation.

Thank you for viewing this repository!
